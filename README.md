# SSH Askpass

nps-ssh-askpass does exactly the same job as x11-ssh-askpass, but it's not as hard to compile on MacOS, because it doesn't require xmkmf.


## Building from source

1. Install the [JX Application Framework](https://github.com/jafl/jx_application_framework),  and set the `JX_ROOT` environment variable to point to its `include` directory.
1. `makemake`
1. `make`


## Installing a binary

http://sourceforge.net/p/nps-ssh-askpass/

The easiest way to install from the binary package is to run `sudo ./install`

Otherwise, the program (nps-ssh-askpass) should be placed in a directory that is on your execution path.  `/usr/bin` or `~/bin` are usually good choices.  Copy the libraries in `lib/` to a directory on your `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

### Requirements

On MacOS, this program requires XQuartz, the X11 server.  Before running this program, you must first start XQuartz.
